Here's a **meticulous and structured plan of action** for your **Amazon Employee Access Prediction** project. Itâ€™s broken down into **10 phases**, each with **clear sub-steps** â€” ideal for pasting into your GitHub README and tracking progress incrementally:

---

## ðŸ“Š Employee Access Prediction - Project Plan

> Predict whether an Amazon employee will be granted access to a resource using classical ML models, with benchmarking and interpretability analysis.

---

### âœ… Phase 1: Project Setup

1.1 Create project folder `emp-access-prediction`
1.2 Initialize Git and `.gitignore`
1.3 Create a virtual environment (optional)
1.4 Install required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `catboost`, `lightgbm`, `shap`, etc.
1.5 Create `notebooks/`, `data/`, `src/`, and `outputs/` directories

---

### âœ… Phase 2: Dataset Understanding

2.1 Load the dataset into a DataFrame
2.2 Explore column names, dtypes, null values
2.3 Check class distribution of the target (`ACTION`)
2.4 Check unique value counts in each feature
2.5 Create a basic EDA summary notebook

---

### âœ… Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.1 Analyze cardinality of categorical features
3.2 Visualize feature distributions using count plots
3.3 Analyze correlations between features (if meaningful)
3.4 Analyze target-wise feature distribution
3.5 Save EDA visuals in `outputs/plots`

---

### âœ… Phase 4: Preprocessing

4.1 Encode categorical features (try Label, One-Hot, and Target Encoding)
4.2 Train/test split using `StratifiedShuffleSplit`
4.3 Feature scaling (if required for some models)
4.4 Prepare a reusable preprocessing pipeline in `src/preprocessing.py`
4.5 Save processed data if needed

---

### âœ… Phase 5: Baseline Modeling

5.1 Train a **Logistic Regression** model
5.2 Train a **Decision Tree**
5.3 Train a **Random Forest**
5.4 Train a **XGBoost** model
5.5 Train a **CatBoost** model
5.6 Store predictions and evaluation results

---

### âœ… Phase 6: Evaluation and Metrics

6.1 Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
6.2 Plot Confusion Matrix
6.3 Plot ROC Curve and compute AUC
6.4 Compare model performances side-by-side
6.5 Discuss overfitting/underfitting from training vs validation

---

### âœ… Phase 7: Hyperparameter Tuning

7.1 Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for best 2â€“3 models
7.2 Tune Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
7.3 Log best parameters and scores
7.4 Store tuned model objects using `pickle`

---

### âœ… Phase 8: Interpretability & Feature Importance

8.1 Extract feature importances from tree-based models
8.2 Use **SHAP** for XGBoost or CatBoost
8.3 Visualize top 10 contributing features
8.4 Discuss practical implications (even if features are anonymized)
8.5 Document feature-level insights

---

### âœ… Phase 9: Final Model Selection & Packaging

9.1 Choose best model based on metrics + interpretability
9.2 Save model and vectorizer with `joblib`/`pickle`
9.3 Write an `inference.py` script to make predictions on new data
9.4 Prepare a `requirements.txt` and `README.md`

---

### âœ… Phase 10: Documentation & GitHub Upload

10.1 Finalize README with:

* Problem statement
* Dataset link
* Folder structure
* Methodology
* Results summary
* Future improvements
  10.2 Upload notebooks, scripts, and outputs to GitHub
  10.3 Push changes regularly with meaningful commit messages
  10.4 (Optional) Deploy as a mini Streamlit app to showcase model predictions

---

## ðŸ§  Bonus Suggestions (Optional but Impressive)

* Add **unit tests** for your functions (`pytest`)
* Add **Makefile** or **run.py** to orchestrate steps
* Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces or Render
* Write a blog post summarizing learnings and trade-offs
